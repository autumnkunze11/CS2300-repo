public class pseudocode{
	//Part 1 
	//I created a 2x2 matrix for A, then I created a a 2x1 matrix for b to be able to solve for x
	//I used gaussian elimination to solve for x 
	//I checked to make sure the system was not inconsistent or underdetermined
	//I then made sure to print the output to an output file 
	
	
	//Part 2 
	//I created a 2x2 matrix and then computed the eigenvalues
	//Then I checked to make sure the values were real 
	//if not then the program printed out a message saying the values were not real 
	//Then I solved for the diagonal matrix and printed it out 
	//Then I solved for the eigenvectors
	//Then I printed it out 
	//I solved for the matrix composition
	//Then I was able to print all values to the file
	
	//Part 3 
	//I read the points into a 2x2 matrix
	//Then I computed the area of the triangle 
	//Using the area I computed the distance to the bisector 
	//I put all these values into an output file
